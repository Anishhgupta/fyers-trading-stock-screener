"""
Rebuilds a properly warm-started training set for a given day's tick
CSV, instead of the cold-start replay ml.labeling.build_training_set()
uses by default.

WHY THIS EXISTS (found 2026-09-02): main.py warm-starts SMMA from the
broker's historical-candle endpoint at every live startup, so it can
detect crossovers almost immediately. build_training_set() previously
always replayed cold -- no warm-start -- so it had to spend the first
~2 hours of a day's OWN tick data just re-warming SMMA20/120 before
detecting any crossover, silently losing every real crossover that
happened during that window. Confirmed directly: a live session on
2026-09-02 logged 18 real ML-scored crossovers (1 accepted + 17
avoided), but a cold-start replay of that same day's tick CSV
reconstructed only 1.

This script fetches the SAME KIND of historical candles main.py uses,
but ending exactly at the tick CSV's first recorded timestamp (not
"now") so there's no time overlap between the historical warm-start
window and the tick CSV's own data.

Requires a live broker connection (valid .env credentials) since it
calls the broker's historical-candle REST endpoint -- this works any
time of day, not just during market hours, as long as the requested
date range is a real trading period.

Usage:
    python -m ml.rebuild_with_warmstart --tick-csv data/store/ticks_2026-09-02.csv --broker fyers
